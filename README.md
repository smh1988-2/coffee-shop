# Instructions

- run `bundle install`
- build out the models and migrations
- create some seeds
- build out the methods under the challenges section
- run `rake console` and test your code

# Getting Started

- We have three models: `Customer`, `Order`, and `Coffee`.

- A `Customer` has many `Order`s, a `Coffee` has many `Order`s, and an `Order` belongs to a `Coffee` and to a `Customer`.
- `Customer` - `Coffee` is a many to many relationship.

- a Customer should have a name
- a Coffee should have a title
- an Order should have a price
- Which is the single source of truth? (aka which table will have the columns for the foreign keys)
